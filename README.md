# dollar_token

1) In a first phase, we would build a prototype that would consist of a $1 contract between two parties. That's it! There would not be exchanges, transferability of the token between one person and the other etc....
None of that fancy stuff. Just a contract between you and me where I would have to put $2 worth of ETH, where you would have a claim of $1 and that would release its value in one of these events:
- if either one of us decide to "get out". In that case, you would get $1 and I would get the remainder in ETH
- if the value of the balance falls below $1.10. In that case, the funds would be released the same way but without requiring a manual intervention
We should also add the possibility for the person on the ETH side (me in that case) to claim anything that would be above $2.
